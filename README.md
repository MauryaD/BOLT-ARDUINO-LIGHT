# BOLT-ARDUINO-LIGHT

## Control your rooms lights with your voice.
----
In this project I've created a scenario to control lights of your room using your *smartphone*. 
I've interfaced the Bolt IoT WiFi module and Arduino UNO for the setup and used IFFFT for the communication/command transfer.

Using google assistant your lights can be controlled, you just have say some simple phrases, like, 'Turn the lights ON'.
